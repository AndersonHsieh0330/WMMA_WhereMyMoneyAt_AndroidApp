# WMMA_WhereMyMoneyAt_AndroidApp
This is a full-stack application I built that allows you to keep track of your expenses!
<br/>
<br/>
WhereMyMoneyAt is a CRUD application and this repository is the front-end Android part of this project. I used Retrofit to fetch data from [WMMA_RESTAPI](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/WMMA_WhereMyMoneyAt_RestAPI), Manipulating data in the remote PostgreSQL database. On top of fetching data through HTTP requests, I also used SQlite(with the help of Room) for local cache so you can access data offline. However, Editing, Creating, and Deleting Data offline is not supported. 
<br/>
**Note: The [WMMA_RESTAPI](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/WMMA_WhereMyMoneyAt_RestAPI) is published on Heroku, but Heroku puts the API to sleep after a certain amount of idle time. Thus the first HTTP request might take longer than usual. Please wait for a little longer or send another GET request to wake up the server, if the respond time appears to be slow.**


## WMMA supports:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete Transaction data


## Some new things Iâ€™ve learned:
- Enhance MVVM project structure
- Using Retrofit to fetch data from a Web API
- Using Room to keep local data cache in SQLite
- Using LiveData and ViewModel 
- Custome ViewModelFactory


## Libraries and resources I used 
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [SwipeRevealLayout](https://github.com/chthai64/SwipeRevealLayout)
- Room + SQLite
- Android LifeCycle Components
